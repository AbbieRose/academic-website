  <p>In <it>Topology: from Art and Math to Contemporary Cities,</it> Michele Emmer argues that computers have ushered in a new architectural age. Emmer claims that when we are children, we live in a topological world denoted by a network of connections between significant places and things. As we transition into adulthood, we become embedded in metric Cartesian space. This framework is superimposed on our previously established understanding because it is most convenient. Emmer allows that while the Cartesian metric will always be the most convenient representational space, computers allow us to return to our original topological understanding.</p>
  <p>But this is only a first step. Why should this be limited to our consumption? We should be producing topological art. I propose decoupling the return to topological thinking from computers, and the democratization of topological creation. </p>
  <p>Topologies and geometries are different sets of rules with which one can reason about space. Materials provide yet another set of constraints- clay is soft and malleable, wood is rigid. Art is the framework through which we can map topological and geometrical constraints onto material constraints. In order to explore this, I’ll choose a particular mapping from math to material and answer the question: <it>How do people reason about constrained spaces using a set of materials with different constraints? </it></p>
